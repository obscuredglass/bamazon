# Bamazon App

This is an app that starts off making tables for items, stock quantity, and "buying" those items. Once you buy an item it lessens the quantity in stock. This requires you to use the packages mysql, inquirer, and cli-table for this program to run properly. The cli-table makes a nice display that updates with the new quantity.
